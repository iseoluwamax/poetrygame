protection salvation

                  WHAT GOD CAN NOT DO DOES NOT EXIST 
                    	The enemies has wanted to bring shame and disgrace across our ways
The devil thought by now our joy would have been stolen away 
He thought we would have died and be buried like suck away
But thank God for God, weâ€™re alive, dining ,wining and partying with takeaway
Even in health and wealth many of us are far stronger than railway
Was it not because Jehovah has driven Satan and his angels far, far away
Treating all with togetherness as a great castaway
