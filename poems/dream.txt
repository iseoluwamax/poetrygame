Dream?
Oh! My beautiful dream
Why should there be a dream without scheme?
Oh! My hopeful dream how I want you to stand on a strong steam
Oh! My strong steam
Are you strong enough to hold the themes of my dream?

Dream! Dream! Dream!
oh! Creamy part of my dream
how you look like a nightmare full of horrors like a horror film
oh! How I dare to dream
should I hide away from my dream?
Oh! How I will look like a coward running from the horrors of my dream
Oh! How should I make a ray of light like a beam
Out of the horrors of my dream?

Dream! Dream! Dream!
Oh! how I love to achieve my dream
Though you look difficult to achieve
Oh! dream am I wrong to believe? 
oh! dream that tells me to live




And not fall like a leaf
Oh! the horrors that flows like a stream
Around the ideas and thoughts of my dream
Now I realize to achieve a dream 
One must go to the extreme
To  bring out the cream of a dream
Scream dream! Scream dream! Scream to my beautiful dream.
